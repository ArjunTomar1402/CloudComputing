   ## User Access:
        Element: User
        Description: Represents the end-user accessing the cloud infrastructure.

   ## SVC (Service):
        Element: Service (SVC)
        Description: The entry point for user requests, which could be a web server or an application server.
        Connection: Connects to Load Balancer.

   ## Load Balancer:
        Element: Load Balancer
        Description: Distributes incoming user requests across multiple servers to ensure reliability and performance.
        Connection: Connects to Proxy.

   ## Proxy:
        Element: Proxy Server
        Description: Acts as an intermediary between the user and backend servers, handling requests and forwarding them to appropriate services.
        Connection: Connects to Worker Nodes.

   ## Worker Nodes:
        Element: Worker Node
        Description: Processes the requests coming from the proxy server. These nodes handle the business logic and data processing.
        Connection: Connects to Data Storage and Spaces CDN.

   ## Data Storage:
        Element: Data Storage
        Description: Stores user data, application data, and any other necessary information. Can include databases, file storage, etc.
        Connection: Connects back to Worker Nodes.

   ## Spaces CDN:
        Element: Spaces CDN (Content Delivery Network)
        Description: Distributes static content (like images, videos, files) closer to the user to reduce latency and improve load times.
        Connection: Connects to Worker Nodes and directly to the User for content delivery.

   ## Monitoring:
        Element: Monitoring System
        Description: Tracks the performance, health, and usage of the infrastructure. Collects metrics and logs for analysis.
        Connection: Connects to all elements (SVC, Load Balancer, Proxy, Worker Nodes, Data Storage, Spaces CDN) to gather data.

 ## Flow Chart Layout:

    Top Layer:
        User
    Second Layer:
        SVC
    Third Layer:
        Load Balancer
    Fourth Layer:
        Proxy
    Fifth Layer:
        Worker Nodes
    Sixth Layer (Parallel):
        Data Storage
        Spaces CDN
    Monitoring:
        Positioned to the side, with connections to all elements.

### Flow Chart Instructions:

    Start with the User element at the top.
    Draw an arrow from User to SVC.
    Draw an arrow from SVC to Load Balancer.
    Draw an arrow from Load Balancer to Proxy.
    Draw an arrow from Proxy to Worker Nodes.
    Draw arrows from Worker Nodes to Data Storage and Spaces CDN.
    Draw a direct arrow from Spaces CDN back to User for content delivery.
    Position the Monitoring element to the side and draw connections from it to all other elements (SVC, Load Balancer, Proxy, Worker Nodes, Data Storage, Spaces CDN).
